# MITRE ATT&CK
## Description
MITRE ATT&CK is a structured matrix of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries at various stages of a cyberattack (https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). It categorizes attacker activities from initial access to post-exploitation objectives. ATT&CK helps describe and analyze adversary activities in the real world. The matrix is ​​continually updated and expanded to account for new threats and techniques.

## Practice
A research analyst uses knowledge of MITRE ATT&CK to:
- Identify attacker methods — analyzing cyber incident reports with reference to ATT&CK tactics and techniques helps to understand what methods were used by attackers.
- Justify conclusions about possible threats — using the ATT&CK framework helps to form an evidence base when analyzing suspicious activity.
- Prepare recommendations for protection — the analyst can propose protection and monitoring measures based on popular attacker techniques.
- Prepare reports for technical specialists — ATT&CK serves as a universal language that allows analysts and Red/Blue Teams to correctly understand attacker tactics and techniques.
- Predict potential attack vectors — MITRE ATT&CK allows you to identify weaknesses in the infrastructure and propose preventive protection measures.
- Analyze APT groups — the ATT&CK database contains profiles of known attackers and their reference to techniques.

## Connection with other knowledge
Knowledge of MITRE ATT&CK is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — ATT&CK is actively used in threat reports to classify attacker actions.
- Threat Hunting — ATT&CK allows you to form hypotheses about hidden threats in the infrastructure based on known attacker techniques.
- Typical vulnerabilities — many ATT&CK techniques are associated with specific vulnerabilities and configuration errors.
- Incident analysis — the framework helps to describe attack vectors and their development by stages.
- Working with the Red/Blue Team — ATT&CK serves as a unified standard for modeling attacks and assessing the effectiveness of protective measures.

## How to improve
- Take official MITRE training: https://attack.mitre.org/resources/learn-more-about-attack/training/cti/
- Learn the official MITRE ATT&CK documentation to understand how tactics and techniques are structured and how they are used in different phases of attacks.
- Practice analyzing incidents using the ATT&CK matrix to determine what techniques attackers used and how they could have been detected or prevented.
- Review attack reports that used ATT&CK techniques to understand how real-world incidents compare to the matrix.
- Integrate MITRE ATT&CK knowledge into your regular activities by demonstrating how each technique or tactic was used in an attack and what steps could be taken to prevent it.
