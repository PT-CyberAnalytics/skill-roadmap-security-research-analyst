# Cyber Kill Chain
## Description
The Cyber ​​Kill Chain is a model developed by Lockheed Martin (https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) that describes the sequence of stages of a cyber attack, from reconnaissance to execution of malicious actions. The model helps to understand how attackers plan and execute attacks, allowing organizations to better defend at each stage of the chain. At each link in the chain, measures can be taken to detect or stop an attack before it is completed.

## Practice
Although the analyst is not directly involved in detecting attacks through monitoring tools, it is important for them to understand the Cyber ​​Kill Chain model in order to interpret the data correctly. For example, if monitoring systems detect an attempt at unauthorized access (vulnerability exploitation), the analyst must know at what stage of the attack the attacker is and what measures to take to minimize the risks. It is important to be able to recognize actions at different stages, such as reconnaissance, establishing communication with the system, executing malicious code, and exfiltration of data.

## Connection with other knowledge
The Cyber ​​Kill Chain model is closely related to incident analysis and cyberattack investigation practices, as well as other frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, which detail the tactics and techniques used by attackers. Understanding the Cyber ​​Kill Chain helps to better analyze logs and events provided by monitoring systems and to formulate effective response strategies. The model can also be used to build reports and recommendations for protection based on the stages of an attack.

## How to improve
- Learn all phases of the Cyber ​​Kill Chain model, from reconnaissance to attack execution, to better understand attackers’ actions at each stage.
- Practice analyzing logs and incident reports using the Cyber ​​Kill Chain model to determine the attack stage and effective responses at each stage.
- Study real-world cyber-attack cases to understand how malicious actions can progress through the Kill Chain stages and what defense mechanisms help to stop an attack at different stages.
- Explore other attack analysis models, such as MITRE ATT&CK and NIST, to understand attacker tactics and techniques holistically and integrate this knowledge into reporting.
- Practice using the Cyber ​​Kill Chain to create defense strategies aimed at preventing attacks at each stage, from reconnaissance to data exfiltration.
- Participate in Cyber ​​Kill Chain-based drills and attack simulations to better understand attacker tactics and develop measures for effective incident response.
