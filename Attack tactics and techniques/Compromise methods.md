# Compromise methods
## Description
This section is devoted to studying the methods that attackers use to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or accounts. Understanding compromise methods allows research analysts to identify potential attack vectors, analyze their impact, and develop recommendations for preventing them.

Compromise methods cover a wide range of techniques, including:
- Phishing - creating fake emails, websites, or messages to steal credentials or install malware.
- Social engineering - manipulating people to obtain confidential information.
- Brute force - guessing passwords to accounts or systems.
- Credential stuffing - mass checking of leaked passwords on various resources.
- Exploitation - using vulnerabilities in software or configurations to gain access.
- Supply Chain Attacks — Compromising partners, contractors, or suppliers to gain access to the target organization.
- MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) — Intercepting data in transit.
- Network Attacks — Exploiting weaknesses in network infrastructure, such as insecure protocols or misconfigured routers.
- Active Directory Attacks — Exploiting vulnerabilities in domain infrastructure to escalate privileges and move through the network.
- Malware — Infecting systems with malicious software (Trojans, ransomware, keyloggers, etc.).
- Public Service Attacks — Exploiting weakly protected web applications, FTP servers, APIs, and other open services.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of compromise methods to:
- Threat identification — understanding attacker methods allows identifying possible attack vectors on infrastructure or employees.
- Formation of hypotheses within Threat Hunting — the analyst uses knowledge of compromise methods to put forward hypotheses about hidden attacks.
- Analysis of incidents — understanding attack vectors allows analysts to correctly describe the sequence of actions of the attacker and propose protective measures.
- Development of recommendations for protection — the analyst proposes measures to strengthen protection, adapted to popular compromise techniques.
- Preparation of analytical materials — articles, reports and reference materials on the topic of compromise methods allow raising the awareness of technical specialists and customers.

## Connection with other knowledge
Compromise methods are closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — the analyst uses data on new attack methods to identify threats.
- Threat Hunting — searching for signs of compromise in the infrastructure requires knowledge of current attack methods.
- OSINT — analysis of public data helps to identify vulnerable services or leaked credentials.
- Event monitoring — knowledge of compromise methods helps to correctly interpret anomalies and possible attacks.
- Presentation of results — when preparing analytical reports, the analyst must clearly explain what methods were used by attackers.

## How to improve
- Learn the MITRE ATT&CK Framework: The Initial Access section contains a full list of techniques that attackers use to initially penetrate infrastructure.
- Explore real-life compromise cases: Studying reports on cyberattacks from Positive Technologies, Mandiant, and other information security leaders will help you better understand the practical application of hacking techniques.
- Develop vulnerability analysis skills: Understanding the weaknesses in software and systems helps you anticipate possible compromise scenarios.
- Practice malware analysis: Understanding malware delivery methods (e.g., via phishing emails or fake websites) will help you identify threats at an early stage.
- Learn popular attack tools: Understanding how hacker utilities work (e.g., Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit) will help you recognize their activity from logs or artifacts on compromised systems.
- Develop attack modeling skills: Practice attack scenarios on testbeds to learn compromise methods and practice defense skills.
- Keep up to date with new attack techniques: Constantly study publications on new compromise methods and update your knowledge.
