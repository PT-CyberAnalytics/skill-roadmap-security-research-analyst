# Malware
## Description
This section is devoted to the study of various types of malware (malware), their operating principles, attacker goals, and distribution methods. Understanding malware helps research analysts identify threats, predict attack vectors, and develop recommendations for their prevention.

The main types of malware include:
- Trojans are programs that disguise themselves as legitimate software, but actually perform malicious actions.
- Ransomware encrypts user data to extort a ransom.
- Spyware collects confidential data without the user's knowledge.
- Worms spread independently over the network, damaging systems or intercepting data.
- Backdoors provide an attacker with hidden access to the system.
- Botnets are compromised devices united in a network to carry out attacks.
- Keyloggers — record keystrokes on the keyboard to steal credentials.
- Rootkits — programs that mask the activity of an intruder in the system.
- Adware and PUP (Potentially Unwanted Programs) — unwanted software containing advertising or potentially dangerous functions.
- Fileless Malware — malicious software that operates in the system memory without leaving traces on the disk, making it difficult to detect.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of malware to:
- Detect threats at early stages — analyze signs of malware activity based on logs and network traffic.
- Prepare analytical reports — describe new malware samples and recommend how to neutralize them.
- Formulate protection recommendations — propose measures to prevent malware penetration and increase infrastructure resilience.
- Conduct Threat Intelligence research — monitor the activity of attack groups specializing in distributing malware.

## Connection with other knowledge
Knowledge of malware is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — the analyst uses data on new malware types to predict attack vectors.
- Common vulnerabilities — many malware samples use known vulnerabilities to penetrate systems.
- Blue Team expertise — the analyst can develop rules for detecting malware in security systems (EDR, SIEM, etc.).

## How to improve
- Learn malware classification: Understanding the different types of malware and their features allows you to identify threats faster.
- Practice malware behavior analysis: Use specialized tools to study the activity of malware samples (e.g. Any.Run, Cuckoo Sandbox, Hybrid Analysis).
- Learn sandbox techniques: These tools allow you to safely launch and analyze suspicious files in an isolated environment.
- Analyze logs and network traffic: Practice identifying traces of malicious activity based on data from monitoring systems.
- Learn popular techniques for bypassing defense mechanisms: Many malware samples can bypass antiviruses, EDR systems, and behavioral analyzers.
- Follow new malware samples: Monitor reports on new threats on the resources of companies such as Positive Technologies, Kaspersky, Mandiant, Microsoft Security to learn about current threats in a timely manner.
- Learn the basics of reverse engineering: Understanding the structure of executable files and the basic principles of disassembly will help you analyze malware behavior more deeply.
- Analyze real incidents: Practicing malware analysis using real attacks as an example helps develop critical thinking and threat recognition skills.
