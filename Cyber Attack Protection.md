# Cyber Attack Protection
## Description
This section is devoted to the development of practical recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities found in IT infrastructure, web applications, authentication systems, network services and other components of information systems. A research analyst does not conduct pentests or write reports on their results, but he or she must be able to formulate comprehensive recommendations for closing vulnerabilities based on the study of new threats, attack trends and vulnerable configurations.

Recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities may include:
- Using patches and updates — fixing vulnerable components at the OS, application and library level.
- Changing configurations — adjusting security settings to minimize attack vectors.
- Updating security policies — adjusting access control rules, data storage and authentication processes.
- Isolating vulnerable systems — temporarily restricting access or switching services to safe mode until they are fully protected.
- Improving logging and monitoring — strengthening the control system to promptly identify attempts to exploit a vulnerability.
- Measures to reduce the attack surface include removing unused services, closing unnecessary ports, and disabling obsolete protocols.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of vulnerability mitigation methods to:
- Form recommendations for infrastructure protection — develop well-founded proposals to close current threats based on known attack vectors.
- Analyze incidents and their consequences — based on identified vulnerabilities, the analyst can propose corrective measures to prevent repeated attacks.
- Create materials on cyber threats — a research analyst can publish articles, reports, or reference materials with practical recommendations on protection.
- Prepare recommendations for various audiences — develop materials that will be understandable to both technical specialists and management.
- Create universal protection practices — the analyst can form universal guides on the secure configuration of services and systems.

## Connection with other knowledge
Developing recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — knowledge of current attack techniques helps create recommendations adapted to modern threats.
- Typical vulnerabilities — the analyst must understand the nature of the vulnerability in order to offer correct ways to eliminate it.
- Compromise methods — understanding hacking methods helps offer measures that effectively close attack vectors.
- Data collection and processing — the analyst must be able to extract information about fresh vulnerabilities from various sources and promptly develop protection measures.

## How to improve
- Learn popular vulnerability databases: Get familiar with the CVE, NVD, Exploit-DB, Positive Technologies Research and other sources of data on new threats.
- Develop your CVSS vulnerability analysis skills: Understanding the criticality rating system will allow you to correctly interpret risks and determine priority protection measures.
- Learn recommendations for secure system configuration: Study CIS Benchmarks, Microsoft Security Baselines and similar resources to understand best practices for protecting infrastructure.
- Practice analyzing recent incidents: Analyzing real attacks helps you propose effective protection measures based on successful attacker strategies.
- Keep an eye on new exploitation techniques: Understanding hacking methods will allow you to formulate preventive protection measures.
- Analyze patches and their impact: Practice studying update descriptions and their possible side effects.
- Publish protection recommendations: Work on articles and analytical materials that help other specialists understand how to close vulnerabilities and prevent attacks.
- Learn Zero-day attack protection practices: Develop skills to identify and mitigate risks associated with unpatched vulnerabilities.
