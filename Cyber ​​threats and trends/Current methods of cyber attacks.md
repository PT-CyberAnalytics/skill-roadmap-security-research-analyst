# Current methods of cyber attacks

## Description
Current cyber attack methods cover modern techniques and tactics used by attackers to hack systems, steal data, gain access to networks, and perform other malicious actions. These methods include attacks using zero-day exploits, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, supply chain attacks, and social engineering attacks. Understanding current attack methods helps an analyst analyze potential threats and suggest measures to prevent them.

## Practice
The analyst is not directly involved in attack defense, but must be able to analyze penetration test results and data from pentesters to recognize what modern attack methods have been used or could be used against the organization. For example, if a phishing attack was carried out, the analyst must be able to analyze the consequences of such an attack and suggest measures to strengthen protection (employee training, mail filtering, etc.). Understanding current attack methods also helps analysts generate reports and recommendations for strengthening the security of the infrastructure.

## Connection with other knowledge
Modern attack methods are closely related to the Cyber ​​Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK models, which describe the tactics and techniques used at each stage of an attack. Knowing current cyberattack methods helps analysts better analyze logs and monitoring data, associate events with specific attack techniques, and suggest measures to prevent them. This section is also related to vulnerability management, as many current attacks exploit unprotected systems and outdated software.

## How to improve
- Stay up-to-date with new threats and attack methods by reading security reports from leading cybersecurity companies (Positive Technologies, Kaspersky, CrowdStrike, Mandiant) and Threat Intelligence platforms.
- Learn phishing, ransomware, and supply chain attack techniques to better understand how attackers use modern methods to compromise organizations.
- Learn about the tools attackers use to conduct attacks, such as Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, and learn to recognize their traces in reports and logs.
- Learn how to analyze real incident reports to understand how attackers use different techniques in real-world scenarios and what mitigation measures can be suggested.
- Use your knowledge of modern attack methods to create recommendations for hardening your defenses, from phishing and social engineering to preventing the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Participate in attack simulation training to better understand how attackers use modern techniques in real-world situations and how to minimize risks.
