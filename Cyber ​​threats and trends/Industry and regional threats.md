# Industry and regional threats
## Description
This section is devoted to the study of threats that are characteristic of specific business sectors or individual regions. Different sectors (financial, industrial, government, telecommunications, etc.) have their own characteristics that determine typical attack vectors and protection methods. In addition, the political and economic situation in different regions affects the activity of attackers and targeted attacks.

Examples of industry threats:
- Financial sector - attacks on payment systems, ATMs, online banking, as well as fraudulent schemes.
- Energy and industry - threats associated with attacks on SCADA systems, IoT devices and critical infrastructure.
- Medicine - theft of patient data, extortion and attacks on medical devices.
- Education and science - attacks on research projects, theft of intellectual property.
- Public sector - targeted attacks on government resources to obtain political, economic or military information.

Examples of regional threats:
- In the CIS countries, attacks on electronic document management systems, government resources, and large companies are common.
- In European countries, threats related to the protection of personal data (GDPR) are active, as are attacks on financial organizations.
- In Asia, campaigns involving cyber spies are common, as are attacks on high-tech enterprises and manufacturing facilities.
- In the USA and American countries, attacks on corporations, retail, and financial institutions are more often recorded.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of regional and industry threats to:
- Build analytical forecasts — understanding trends in various sectors helps to anticipate potential attacks and adapt protective measures.
- Form practical recommendations — the analyst suggests protective measures taking into account the specifics of the industry or region.
- Analyze targeted attacks — when studying threats, it is possible to identify patterns in the behavior of attackers by analyzing their tactics and goals.
- Prepare analytical reports and reports — knowledge of industry specifics helps to competently explain risks to business and offer targeted solutions.
- Work with the media — the analyst can explain the nature of threats in certain areas or regions in an accessible form.

## Connection with other knowledge
The study of industry and regional threats is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — information about active threats and attack groups allows you to adapt protective measures to specific industries.
- Cyber ​​threats and trends — industry risks shape global trends in the world of cybersecurity.
- Political and economic factors — in times of crisis or conflict, individual industries or regions can become priority targets for attackers.
- Protection from cyber attacks — understanding industry risks helps to form comprehensive protective strategies.

## How to improve
- Analyze targeted attack reports: Study publications from leading information security companies (e.g. Positive Technologies, Mandiant, Kaspersky) to understand specific threats for different industries and regions.
- Study regulatory requirements for different industries: Understanding PCI DSS, HIPAA, SWIFT and other standards will allow you to better analyze risks and propose protective measures.
- Monitor new campaigns by APT groups: Such attacks often target specific industries or regions, which allows you to predict possible threats.
- Assess economic and political factors: Understanding global and regional processes will help predict changes in the threat landscape.
- Practice incident analysis in specific sectors: Analyze real attack cases in industries to identify the most vulnerable points and propose protective measures.
- Learn specialized information sources: Monitor industry blogs, Telegram channels, forums and information security conferences to promptly identify new threats.
