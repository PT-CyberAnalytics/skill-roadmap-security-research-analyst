# Emerging Technologies
## Description
The Emerging Technologies section is dedicated to studying new and developing technologies that impact cybersecurity. These technologies can both enhance protection and become tools for attackers. Understanding their principles and possible risks allows research analysts to predict future threats and develop recommendations for adapting security systems.

Emerging technologies include:
- Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) — for automating attacks or protection.
- Blockchain — for both secure transactions and for creating attack-resistant infrastructures.
- Quantum computing — capable of both destroying traditional cryptographic methods and strengthening them.
- 5G and IoT (Internet of Things) — new attack scenarios for devices and networks with a large number of connections.
- Process automation — solutions for automated incident response and infrastructure management.

## Practice
A research analyst can apply knowledge of emerging technologies to:
- Analyze new threats — predict attack methods that may appear with the development of technologies.
- Identify potential risks — assess possible threats to business based on the introduction of new technologies.
- Develop recommendations — suggestions for the safe introduction of new technologies into corporate infrastructure.
- Explain trends for business — prepare analytical materials and reports on the impact of technologies on the field of cybersecurity.
- Form protection strategies — develop approaches to adapting protection tools taking into account new threats.

## Connection with other knowledge
The topic of promising technologies is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — new technologies are actively discussed on forums and in specialized sources, which allows identifying possible risks in advance.
- Threat Hunting — understanding new attack methods helps to form hypotheses about possible threats.
- Protection from cyber attacks — developing recommendations for the implementation of secure configurations and protective mechanisms for new technologies.
- Cyber ​​threats and trends — promising technologies often become the basis for new attack methods and require constant monitoring.
