# Political and economic factors of cyber attacks
## Description
This section is devoted to studying the influence of the political and economic environment on the activity of attackers and the emergence of new threats. Political conflicts, sanctions, economic crises and unstable international conditions often become catalysts for targeted attacks, cyber espionage and large-scale cyber crises.

Examples of the influence of political and economic factors on cyber attacks:
- Geopolitical tension - the use of cyber attacks as a tool to influence the economy or security of other countries.
- Sanctions regimes - attackers can attack countries or companies involved in economic conflicts.
- Economic instability - financial fraudsters become more active in times of crisis, attacking banking systems, crypto exchanges and online trading platforms.
- Election campaigns and protests - politically motivated attacks aimed at compromising candidates, manipulating public opinion or discrediting the authorities.
- Energy conflicts are attacks on enterprises in the fuel and energy complex to exert economic pressure or undermine infrastructure.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of political and economic factors to:
- Threat forecasting — understanding the political and economic situation in regions allows one to anticipate possible attack scenarios.
- Identifying the motives of attackers — analyzing political conflicts helps to understand the goals of attackers and predict their further actions.
- Risk assessments for companies and organizations — the analyst can suggest additional protection measures for enterprises operating in high-threat zones.
- Preparing analytical reports — knowledge of political and economic factors allows one to add important context to threat reports.
- Threat justifications for the media and business — understanding the political background of attacks helps to competently comment on incidents.

## Connection with other knowledge
Political and economic factors are closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence - data on political and economic factors is often used to enrich threat intelligence and identify patterns in attacks.
- Industry and regional threats - economic instability or conflicts often increase the number of attacks on certain regions or companies.
- APT groups and hacktivists - such threats often operate against the backdrop of political or economic processes.
- Dark Web - shadow forums often discuss attack plans related to political or economic goals.

## How to improve
- Learn the political and economic environment: Monitor international politics, economic trends, and regional crises to understand how they influence the growth of threats.
- Monitor the activity of APT groups: Analyze their goals, motivations, and methods to assess the influence of political factors on their activity.
- Learn reports on politically motivated attacks: Publications from Positive Technologies, Mandiant, Kaspersky, and other companies allow you to analyze the goals and tactics of such attacks.
- Practice open source data collection: Use OSINT tools to find information about economic crises, conflicts, and their potential consequences.
- Analyze threats in various economic sectors: Understanding industry specifics will help you better assess the impact of the political and economic environment on threats.
- Participate in discussions with experts: Monitoring professional discussions at conferences, forums, and in specialized channels will help expand your understanding of global trends.
