# Dark web

## Description
The Dark Web is a hidden part of the internet that can only be accessed through special browsers like Tor and is used to share information anonymously. The Dark Web has become a platform for cybercriminals to trade stolen data, malware, exploits, and attack tools. It is important for security analysts to understand how the Dark Web is used by criminals to sell data, launch attacks, and distribute malware in order to assess threats and anticipate potential attacks.

## Practice
It is important for an analyst to be able to interpret reports and data related to Dark Web activity, which may include information about the sale of stolen data, leaks of corporate information, or discussions of specific attack tools. The analyst receives information from threat intelligence teams and penetration testers who may monitor the Dark Web for leaks of company data. Based on this data, the analyst can suggest measures to strengthen security, for example, if corporate credentials are found on Dark Web sites.

## Connection with other knowledge
The Dark Web is closely related to incident analysis, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. Understanding Dark Web activity helps analysts predict future threats and respond to data leaks or information about potential attacks. It is also important for analyzing cybercriminal activity and interacting with APT groups that may use the Dark Web to organize attacks and purchase tools to carry out attacks. Dark Web data can be integrated with Threat Intelligence systems to automatically monitor leaks and threats.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of the Dark Web and the technologies used to access it (e.g. Tor) to understand how attackers use it to sell data and launch attacks.
- Monitor Dark Web cybercriminal activity reports from threat intelligence companies (e.g. Recorded Future, KELA) to stay up-to-date on current threats and emerging techniques.
- Understand the types of data and information that is often sold on the Dark Web (e.g. credentials, exploits, malware) to suggest measures to strengthen protection.
- Learn how Dark Web data can be integrated into threat intelligence platforms and used for threat prevention and incident analysis.
- Develop skills in using leak monitoring systems to quickly respond to incidents involving corporate data leaks on the Dark Web.
- Participate in training and workshops on Threat Intelligence and Dark Web analysis to improve your understanding of how cybercriminals use hidden resources to launch attacks and sell stolen data.
