# International trends in cybersecurity
## Description
The International Cybersecurity Trends section covers the study of key global trends that shape the information security landscape. These trends include the emergence of new threats and attack methods, the development of security tools, and changes in approaches to regulation and security at the state and corporate levels.

Current trends include:
- Growth of Supply Chain Attacks — attackers are increasingly compromising companies through vulnerabilities in their contractors and partners.
- Expansion of attacks on cloud environments — the active development of cloud technologies creates new attack vectors, including hacking credentials and configuration errors.
- Activation of APT groups — many cyberattacks are becoming more targeted and complex, targeting government agencies, energy companies, and corporations.
- Increase in attacks on critical infrastructure — objects such as energy grids, transport systems, and telecommunications are becoming priority targets for attackers.
- The development of the Zero Trust concept is an approach that involves abandoning the traditional perimeter approach to security and focusing on continuous access verification.
- The growth of machine learning technologies - both for protecting infrastructure and for carrying out more complex attacks.
- Politically motivated attacks (cyber espionage and hacktivism) - attacks aimed at destabilizing countries or causing economic damage.

## Practice
A research analyst uses knowledge of international trends to:
- Predict threats — by studying global trends, it is possible to predict attack vectors that may soon spread locally.
- Assess business risks — understanding trends helps analyze which threats are most relevant for specific industries and regions.
- Prepare analytical reports — trends allow us to draw conclusions about how the threat landscape is changing and what security measures need to be strengthened.
- Identify new attack methods — understanding trends helps adapt security mechanisms to modern threats.
- Develop recommendations for protection — knowledge of international trends allows us to formulate practical recommendations for organizations operating in different sectors of the economy.

## Connection with other knowledge
The section "International Trends in Cybersecurity" is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence - the analyst uses trend data to enrich threat information and improve the quality of recommendations.
- Threat Hunting - knowledge of trends helps to form hypotheses about potential threats and look for their signs in the infrastructure.
- Promising technologies - understanding new approaches and solutions helps to take into account their impact on security.
- Political and economic factors of cyber attacks - knowledge of global threats helps to link them to the political or economic situation in specific regions.

## How to improve
- Study cyber threat reports: Follow analytical publications from leading cybersecurity companies (e.g. Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, Positive Technologies, Microsoft Security) to understand global trends.
- Monitor incidents at the international level: Analyze major cyberattacks on government agencies, enterprises and organizations to understand their nature and methods of implementation.
- Evaluate new attack and defense methods: Research how attacks on cloud environments, Supply Chain and critical infrastructure are evolving.
- Analyze global legislative trends: Follow changes in approaches to information security regulation (e.g. GDPR, NIS2, CCPA).
- Develop threat prediction skills: Practice trend analysis based on publications, articles and reports on new threats.
- Attend international cybersecurity conferences: Participation (even online) in events such as Black Hat, PHDays, and others will help you keep your finger on the pulse of current trends.
- Practice preparing analytical materials: Work on creating overviews and reports on global threats to learn how to structure information and adapt it to different audiences.
