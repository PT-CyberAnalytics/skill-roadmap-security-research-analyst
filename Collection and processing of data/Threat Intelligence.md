# Threat Intelligence

## Description
Threat Intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information about cyber threats that may impact the security of organizations. It involves studying data about attackers’ methods, tactics, tools, motivations, and goals. Threat Intelligence helps predict future attacks, detect current threats, and develop defense strategies. The primary sources of intelligence are open source (OSINT), commercial Threat Intelligence platforms, and internal company data.

## Practice
The analyst uses Threat Intelligence to:
- Collect threat data: Monitor Dark Web activity, analyze data leaks, track APT groups.
- Interpret information: Analyze indicators of compromise (IOC) such as file hashes, IP addresses, domains associated with malicious activity.
- Create reports: Prepare analytical materials on current and predicted threats for technical specialists and management.
- Enrich monitoring: Use Threat Intelligence data to configure SIEM, EDR, NTA and other security systems.
- Identify targets: Understand which industries, technologies or companies are the main targets of current attacks.

## Connection with other knowledge
Threat Intelligence integrates with various aspects of Blue Team expertise:
- Event Monitoring: Intelligence data is used to set up monitoring and attack detection rules.
- Threat Hunting: Threat Intelligence helps to search for hidden threats in the infrastructure based on known techniques and indicators.
- Attack Models: Data from Threat Intelligence can be used to analyze tactics and techniques using MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber ​​Kill Chain.
- Information Security: Integration of intelligence data into SIEM and EDR helps in proactively protecting the infrastructure.

## How to improve
- Learn IOC types, file hashes, suspicious domains, IP addresses, and more. Learn how to detect and analyze them.
- Practice monitoring Dark Web activity and using OSINT tools like Shodan, Maltego, or Censys to gather information.
- Read cyber threat reports from leading companies to learn approaches to threat analysis.
- Improve your analytical writing skills to present threat data in a clear and structured form.
- Practice enriching SIEM and EDR data using Threat Intelligence information.
- Follow emerging trends and techniques in Threat Intelligence, including the use of machine learning for threat analysis.
