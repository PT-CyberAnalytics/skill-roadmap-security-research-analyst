# Methods of statistical data analysis
## Description
This section is devoted to the study of statistical analysis methods that are used to process large volumes of data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. A research analyst uses statistical analysis to interpret data on cyberattacks, assess their scale, and formulate reasonable conclusions and forecasts.

Statistical analysis helps:
- Identify abnormal behavior in systems or user activity.
- Analyze the frequency, prevalence, and dynamics of various types of attacks.
- Evaluate the impact of vulnerabilities on business processes.
- Build models to predict threats and assess their likelihood.
- Conduct research based on big data.

## Practice
A research analyst uses statistical analysis to:
- Detect anomalies — for example, identify a sharp increase in the number of phishing attacks, unusual activity, or unusual requests on the Internet.
- Assess attack dynamics — analyzing attack statistics for a certain period helps identify trends and predict attacker activity.
- Analyze vulnerability prevalence — identifying the most popular vulnerabilities or attack methods helps build defensive strategies.
- Identify relationships in data — analyzing correlations helps find connections between attacks, threats, and events.
- Predict threats — statistical models can predict an increase in attacker activity or identify new attack vectors.

## Connection with other knowledge 
Statistical data analysis methods are closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — an analyst uses statistics to identify patterns in the behavior of attack groups.
- Threat Hunting — anomaly data analysis helps identify hidden threats in the infrastructure.
- Event monitoring — statistical methods allow you to analyze logs and identify deviations from normal behavior.
- Promising technologies — machine learning algorithms are often built on statistical analysis methods.

## How to improve
- Learn basic statistics: Understanding the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other basic metrics will help you conduct basic data analysis.
- Learn anomaly detection: Practice analyzing your data using statistical methods to find unusual activity.
- Learn to visualize your data: Tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel will help you visualize your analysis.
- Practice programming languages: Learn the basics of Python or R to process data and apply statistical models.
- Analyze real incidents: Practice analyzing cyberattack cases using statistical methods to identify patterns.
- Study specialized literature: Books on applied statistics and data analysis will help you develop skills in interpreting complex models.
