# Automation of data collection processes
## Description
This section is devoted to studying methods and tools that allow you to automate the processes of searching, collecting and processing data necessary for cybersecurity research. Automation reduces the time spent on routine tasks, simplifies threat monitoring and allows you to quickly process large amounts of data.

Automation of data collection is useful for:
- Monitoring shadow forums and Dark Web platforms.
- Searching for new vulnerabilities and exploits.
- Tracking the activity of APT groups and hacktivists.
- Automatically searching for indicators of compromise (IOC).
- Quickly analyzing news, blogs and other Threat Intelligence sources.
- Automated solutions can work on a schedule, notify about changes and collect data in a convenient format for further analysis.

## Practice
A research analyst can use automation to:
- Monitor news and information security reports — automatic parsers can collect data on new threats from RSS feeds, blogs, and social networks.
- Collect data from shadow sources — using bots and scripts to monitor the Dark Web helps quickly identify data leaks and discussions of potential threats.
- Process vulnerability data — scripts for automatic parsing of CVE databases, NVD, Exploit Database, and similar resources allow you to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities.
- Monitor Telegram channels and forums — automation allows you to collect information about new attacks, hacking tools, and intruders.
- Open source scanning (OSINT) — automated solutions help collect information about companies, their infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Connection with other knowledge
Automation of data collection processes is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — automated data collection from specialized sources increases the speed and accuracy of threat detection.
- OSINT — automation allows you to speed up the process of searching for information in open sources.
- Statistical data analysis methods — automated collection of large amounts of data requires competent filtering and interpretation of results.
- Data analysis — automatic scripts often form a "raw" array of data that needs to be analyzed and systematized.

## How to improve
- Learn Python Basics: Learn how to work with data parsing libraries.
- Learn API concepts: Understanding REST API and authentication methods will help you automate interactions with threat intelligence services like VirusTotal, Shodan, or Censys.
- Practice creating parsers: Develop scripts to collect data from news sites, forums, social networks, or the dark web.
- Use ready-made automation tools: Explore the capabilities of solutions that automate the collection and analysis of threat data.
- Develop your own monitoring scenarios: Create solutions that track keywords, brand mentions, IP addresses, or file hashes in open sources.
- Learn database basics: Understanding SQL will help you process and store large volumes of data collected automatically.
- Keep an eye on new automation tools: Try solutions that simplify automated threat monitoring and allow you to quickly adapt processes to new data sources.
