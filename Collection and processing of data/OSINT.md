# OSINT
## Description
OSINT (open source intelligence) is a method of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information available in public sources. This approach allows research analysts to identify threats, analyze the infrastructure of potential attackers or victims, and obtain valuable data for building analytical reports.

OSINT sources include:
- Social networks (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc.).
- Forums and sites on the Dark Web.
- Public databases (Shodan, Censys, Hunter.io, etc.).
- News, blogs, and reports.
- Company registries and court databases.
- Information from domain registrations (WHOIS).
- Vulnerability data platforms (CVE, NVD, etc.).

## Practice
A research analyst uses OSINT to:
- Detect threats — monitoring mentions on the dark web or specialized resources can signal data leaks or planned attacks.
- Check for data leaks — OSINT helps to detect compromised accounts, passwords or internal documents.
- Analyze the activity of APT groups — track their behavior, goals and tools used.
- Monitor politically motivated attacks and cyber campaigns — analyze the activity of hacktivists, DDoS attacks and attacks on the media.

## Connection with other knowledge
OSINT is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — OSINT helps enrich data on attackers, their tactics, and tools.
- Automated data collection — automated scripts allow you to collect information from open sources faster and more efficiently.
- Statistical data analysis methods — data arrays collected through OSINT require competent filtering and analysis.
- Political and economic factors — OSINT helps identify threats related to the geopolitical situation or economic events.

## How to improve
Learn popular OSINT tools:
- Shodan — search for internet devices and services.
- Censys — analyze IP network and domain infrastructure.
- Maltego — a tool for visualizing connections between objects.
- theHarvester — search for email addresses, domains, and subdomains.
- SpiderFoot — a platform for automated OSINT monitoring.
- Recon-ng — a powerful tool for automated data reconnaissance.

- Learn Google Dorking: Practice searching for sensitive information in search engines using special queries (site:, filetype:, inurl:, etc.).
- Learn anonymous methods of working on the network: Understanding the principles of hiding traces will help you conduct OSINT research safely.
- Practice monitoring the Dark Web: Study forums, marketplaces, and resources to find data on hacks and leaks.
- Develop critical thinking skills: Data collected through OSINT requires careful verification for reliability.
- Participate in OSINT challenges and CTF games: Practice on real tasks helps develop practical information search skills.
- Keep an eye on new OSINT tools: Technologies are rapidly developing, and a research analyst must be aware of modern solutions.
