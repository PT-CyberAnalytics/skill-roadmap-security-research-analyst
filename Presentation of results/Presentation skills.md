# Presentation skills
## Description
This section covers the skills needed to create and deliver effective presentations that enable research analysts to effectively communicate their findings to a variety of audiences. 
The ability to structure a presentation logically, visualize data, and speak to an audience is essential when presenting analytical reports, recommendations, or conference papers.

Presentations may be aimed at:
- Technical specialists — reports with technical details of attacks, vulnerabilities, or proposed protection measures.
- Management and business audiences — materials focusing on business risks, financial losses, and threat mitigation measures.
- Media and the general public — explanatory materials describing the threat in a simple and accessible form.

## Practice
A research analyst applies presentation skills to:
- Giving talks at conferences and forums — presenting research findings on cyber threats, trends, or attacks.
- Presenting analytical reports — at meetings with customers or within your team.
- Conducting briefings — promptly explaining threats to senior managers or the media.
- Creating video presentations and webinars — to train employees, clients, or partners.
- Justifying conclusions and recommendations — based on analytical research data.

## Connection with other knowledge
Presentation skills are closely related to:
- Visualization skills - competent presentation of data through graphs, charts and diagrams enhances the perception of information.
- Competent oral speech - the analyst must be able to confidently and clearly express his thoughts.
- Communication skills - interaction with the audience requires the ability to answer questions, argue your conclusions and adapt the presentation to the level of the audience.
- Collection and processing of data - to create presentations, you need the ability to competently interpret and generalize the collected information.

## How to improve
- Learn the principles of building a presentation structure: Practice working according to the formula "introduction → main part → conclusion" to make the materials logical and consistent.
- Develop storytelling skills: Using compelling examples, metaphors and scenarios will increase audience engagement.
- Practice brevity: The ability to present complex topics simply and succinctly increases the effectiveness of the presentation.
- Learn data visualization methods: The right choice of charts, graphs and diagrams helps the audience understand the key points faster.
- Practice public speaking: Participate in public speaking training or public speaking clubs to develop confidence in speaking.
- Work with feedback: Record your presentations on video to analyze strengths and weaknesses.
- Adapt the content to the audience: When creating a presentation, take into account the level of knowledge of the audience - for a technical audience, it is important to show details, and for top managers - to focus on conclusions and implications.
- Practice active audience interaction: Ask questions, engage listeners in dialogue, and offer scenarios for discussion.
