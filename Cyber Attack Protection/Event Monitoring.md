# Event Monitoring
## Description
Event monitoring is the process of monitoring activity in an IT infrastructure to detect anomalies, suspicious activity, and signs of cyberattacks. A research analyst does not work directly with monitoring systems or analyze logs themselves, but may receive data on security events, reports from technical specialists, or summaries of identified threats as input.

This data may include:
- Descriptions of identified threats - such as attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, signs of network attacks, or malware activity.
- Aggregated data on suspicious events - such as anomalous account behavior, spikes in network activity, or mass authentication failures.
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs) - information about malicious IP addresses, file hashes, suspicious domains, and signatures of attack commands.
- Information about advanced attacks - descriptions of bypass techniques or new attack vectors.

## Practice
A research analyst applies knowledge of event monitoring to:
- Interpret data on detected threats - understanding monitoring principles helps analysts correctly explain how exactly a threat was detected and what defense mechanisms worked.
- Analyze attacker techniques - understanding attack chains allows analysts to hypothesize about attacker tactics and methods.
- Prepare recommendations for strengthening protection - a research analyst can suggest measures to adjust monitoring or strengthen protection based on the analysis of new threats.
- Analyze incidents at a high level - a research analyst can work with ready-made summaries of attacker actions and suggest measures to prevent similar attacks.
- Prepare analytical reports - in threat reports, an analyst can explain which attack vectors require increased monitoring.

## Connection with other knowledge
Event monitoring knowledge is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — information about new threats often includes data on methods for detecting them through monitoring systems.
- MITRE ATT&CK — understanding attacker tactics and techniques helps analysts explain at what stage of an attack a threat can be recorded in a monitoring system.
- Threat Hunting — an analyst can describe what traces of an attacker can be found based on the identified techniques.
- Typical vulnerabilities — knowledge of exploitation methods helps interpret the findings of monitoring specialists.
- Information security tools — understanding the capabilities of systems such as SIEM, EDR, and WAF allows research analysts to correctly describe their role in detecting threats.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of working with IOCs (indicators of compromise): Understanding how IOCs are formed and how they are used in security systems will help in analyzing threats.
- Learn the practices of building monitoring scenarios: Understanding what actions of attackers can be detected at different stages of an attack will help develop correct recommendations.
- Read reports on complex attacks: Analysis of real attack cases with a description of the identified signs will help to better understand the practical application of monitoring.
- Watch for new monitoring bypass techniques: Knowing the methods of covert activity of attackers will allow you to offer more effective protection measures.
- Develop the skill of writing recommendations for technical specialists: Understanding the principles of monitoring will allow you to offer specific steps to improve threat detection.
