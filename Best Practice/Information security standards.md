# Information security standards
## Description
This section is devoted to studying generally accepted standards in the field of information security, which describe requirements for ensuring data protection, incident management, threat monitoring and building a secure infrastructure.

Information security standards create unified approaches to information protection and allow organizations to:
- Streamline security processes.
- Conduct an infrastructure security assessment.
- Develop measures to prevent cyberattacks.
- Respond competently to incidents and minimize their consequences.
- Popular information security standards include:
- ISO/IEC 27001 — a standard for creating an information security management system (ISMS).
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) — a guide to building a secure IT infrastructure and responding to incidents.
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) — requirements for protecting payment card data.
- CIS Benchmarks (Center for Internet Security) — recommendations for setting up secure configurations of operating systems, applications, and network equipment.
- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) — a methodology for identifying and eliminating web vulnerabilities.
- MITRE ATT&CK — attack tactics and techniques used by intruders.
- COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) — a model for IT management and security at the business level.
- ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) — a methodology for managing IT services, including information security issues.

## Practice
The research analyst applies knowledge of information security standards to:
- Analyze incidents — understanding standards helps identify violations in information security processes.
- Prepare recommendations for enhancing security — standards contain practical recommendations for increasing the resilience of the infrastructure.
- Assess the level of security maturity — using checklists from standards helps identify weaknesses in security processes.
- Analyze penetration testing reports — knowledge of standards allows you to correctly interpret audit results and propose effective measures to eliminate vulnerabilities.
- Prepare analytical reports and articles — references to international standards increase the level of trust in the analyst's recommendations.

## Connection with other knowledge
Information security standards are closely related to:
- Presentation of results - the analyst must be able to explain the impact of standards on the level of security.
- Protection from cyber attacks - standards describe practical measures to minimize risks.
- Analysis of incidents - understanding the standards helps to generate correct reports on identified violations.
- Industry and regional threats - some standards (for example, PCI DSS, HIPAA) regulate data protection in specific sectors.

## How to improve
- Learn the structure and requirements of ISO/IEC 27001: Understanding the fundamentals of an information security management system (ISMS) helps you analyze your organization's compliance with standards.
- Explore the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: This document provides recommendations for building a security system and responding to incidents.
- Practice analyzing PCI DSS requirements: Studying this standard will help you evaluate the level of protection of payment data.
- Understand the OWASP Top 10: This list of vulnerabilities forms a knowledge base for the most common risks in web applications.
- Study the CIS Benchmarks: Practicing configuring systems according to these recommendations will allow you to propose measures to strengthen the protection of your infrastructure.
- Follow standard updates: Information security standards are regularly revised, so it is important to study the latest versions.
- Practice adapting standards to business tasks: Learn to explain the requirements of standards in the context of risks and business processes.
- Develop the skill of working with standards checklists: Practice creating checklists to assess the compliance of infrastructure with standards requirements.
