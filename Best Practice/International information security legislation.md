# International information security legislation
## Description
This section is devoted to the study of key international regulations and standards governing information security and data protection. Knowledge of international information security legislation helps research analysts take into account legal aspects when analyzing threats, developing recommendations for protecting infrastructure, and preparing analytical materials for international customers.

International information security legislation covers the following key areas:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a pan-European regulation on the protection of personal data.
- NIS2 (Network and Information Security Directive) is an EU directive on ensuring the cybersecurity of critical facilities.
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a data security standard for the payment card industry.
- SWIFT CSP (Customer Security Programme) is a security standard for organizations working with the SWIFT interbank transfer system.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for building an information security management system (ISMS).

## Practice
The research analyst applies knowledge of international information security legislation to:
- Analyze incidents taking into account international standards — understanding the requirements of GDPR or HIPAA allows you to correctly assess the risks associated with data leaks or cyberattacks.
- Prepare recommendations for data protection — the analyst forms practical measures to protect information in accordance with international requirements.
- Develop analytical reports — when analyzing threats at the international level, it is important to take into account local legislative features.
- Prepare materials for foreign customers and readers — knowledge of international standards helps to adapt recommendations and conclusions for clients in different countries.
- Assess the legal consequences of cyberattacks — when analyzing incidents, it is important to understand the requirements for notifying regulators, affected users and other stakeholders.

## Connection with other knowledge
International information security legislation is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — understanding the legal aspects helps analyze threats in different regions and take into account local peculiarities.
- Industry and regional threats — different countries and business areas require compliance with unique norms and standards.
- Presentation of results — the analyst must be able to explain how international requirements affect information protection and what measures need to be taken.
- Working with the media — when commenting on major international incidents, the analyst must take into account the requirements for data confidentiality and disclosure of information.

## How to improve

- Familiarize yourself with international information security standards: Understanding the principles of ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST will allow you to build high-level security measures.
- Keep up to date with legislative changes: Regulatory requirements are updated regularly, so it is important to stay up to date with new regulations and their interpretations.
- Study cases of violations of international regulations: Analysis of real cases of data leaks and litigation will help you understand which errors lead to fines and reputational losses.
- Develop the skill of adapting recommendations to different regions: Practice writing recommendations that take into account the requirements of different countries and industries.
- Participate in international conferences and webinars: Cybersecurity events often include discussions on the legal aspects of data protection.
