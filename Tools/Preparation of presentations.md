# Preparation of presentations
## Description
Presentation preparation is the skill of creating visual and structured materials to convey analytical information to various audiences. Presentations allow you to not only talk about the results of research, but also to visualize complex concepts, threats, and trends in cybersecurity.

A research analyst prepares presentations for:
- Business meetings - to discuss research results and recommendations with management or a wider audience.
- Technical specialists - with an emphasis on threats, attack methods, and protection methods.
- Speaking at conferences - to convey analytical information to a wider audience.
- Working with the media - when preparing public comments or explaining complex topics.
- Internal training of teams - to transfer knowledge within an organization or during training.
- Popular tools for preparing presentations include:
- Microsoft PowerPoint - a classic tool for creating slides and animations.
- Google Slides - a cloud solution for collaborative work on presentations.
- Keynote - a tool for preparing presentations on Apple devices.
- Canva is a service with ready-made templates for creating visually attractive materials.

## Practice
A research analyst uses presentation skills to:
- Visualize complex ideas — diagrams, graphs, and illustrations make technical topics easier to understand.
- Justify conclusions — graphically presenting data and facts helps support arguments.
- Grab the audience’s attention — well-designed slides help keep participants interested.
- Structurize information — a well-designed presentation makes a report logical and consistent.
- Create templates for typical presentations — this helps reduce the time it takes to prepare standard materials.

## Connection with other knowledge
Presentation skills are closely related to:
- Public speaking - the presentation often becomes the main visual tool during a report.
- Analytical reports - key findings from the text can be adapted into a presentation format.
- Working with the media - presentation materials help to clearly explain complex topics to journalists or the public.
- Soft skills - creating effective slides requires the ability to highlight the main points and adapt information to the audience.
- Visualization skills - successful presentations often include infographics, diagrams, and visual accents.

## How to improve
- Learn advanced PowerPoint and similar features: Learn animation, triggers, interactive elements, and video to make your presentations more dynamic.
- Practice creating visual diagrams: Using infographics, flowcharts, and diagrams helps convey complex information effectively.
- Develop the skill of presenting thoughts concisely: Practice creating slides with a minimum amount of text and an emphasis on key ideas.
- Follow the principles of readability and visual hierarchy: Use large headings, short bullet points, and contrasting colors to highlight important points.
- Analyze successful presentations: Study examples of presentations at conferences (e.g., DEF CON, Positive Hack Days) to understand successful approaches to data visualization.
- Create presentations with the audience in mind: For business, focus on risks and consequences; for technical specialists, pay attention to the details of attacks and methods of protection.
- Use minimalism in design: Avoid unnecessary elements and complex schemes to make the presentation focused and easy to perceive.
- Develop the skill of working with templates: Ready-made styles and structures will allow you to quickly adapt the presentation to different audiences.
- Practice giving presentations: The skill of presenting material based on slides will help you confidently convey information at any event.
