# Automation
## Description
Automation in the context of a research analyst's work is the use of scripts, macros, and other tools to optimize routine tasks, process data, and improve work efficiency. Understanding the basics of automation allows analysts to speed up data collection, analyze large amounts of information, and reduce the risk of errors when performing repetitive actions.

Automation may include:
- Macros in Microsoft Word and Excel — to automate text formatting, build tables, and process data.
- Python — a universal programming language for data processing, creating automatic reports, collecting data from open sources (OSINT), and integrating various systems.
- SQL — a query language for automatic processing and analysis of data in databases.
- Bash/PowerShell — scripting languages ​​for automating work with file systems, networks, and security tools.
- API integrations — to connect to third-party services, receive data, and process it automatically.

## Practice
A research analyst uses automation to:
- Open source intelligence (OSINT) — writing scripts for automatic monitoring of news, social networks, the darknet, and forums.
- Processing large amounts of data — automated filtering, analysis, and structuring of data.
- Preparing analytical reports — creating templates and automatically filling documents with research results.
- Automating routine tasks — performing the same type of operations (e.g. converting data, processing text files, creating diagrams).
- Creating tools for testing hypotheses — Python or PowerShell scripts help model attacks and analyze their consequences.

## Connection with other knowledge
Automation is closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — automated scripts can collect fresh threat indicators or analyze group activity.
- OSINT — automation helps speed up site monitoring and data analysis.
- Data collection and processing — automation allows you to work effectively with large volumes of information.
- Incident analysis — scripts and automated tools help quickly identify traces of attackers in logs and network traffic.
- Result presentation — automatic creation of graphs, diagrams, and text blocks speeds up report preparation.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of Python: Practice writing scripts to collect data, work with APIs, and automate data processing.
- Explore the capabilities of macros in MS Word and Excel: Macros allow you to automate the creation of template documents, tables, and graphs.
- Get familiar with PowerShell and Bash: These tools will help you automate tasks related to working with files, networks, and security systems.
- Develop the skill of writing SQL queries: This will speed up work with large databases and simplify the search for the information you need.
- Learn libraries for data analysis in Python: For example, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib allow you to effectively process and visualize data.
- Create mini-tools for your team: Automated solutions to simplify internal tasks will increase overall productivity.
