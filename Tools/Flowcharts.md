## Description
The skill of creating diagrams allows research analysts to visualize complex processes, system architecture, attack vectors, or research findings. Well-designed diagrams help structure information, making it easier for both technical specialists and the general public to understand.

Diagrams can be used to:
- Explain the course of an attack - sequentially display the actions of attackers according to MITRE ATT&CK or Cyber ​​Kill Chain.
- Account for incidents - visualize compromise chains, methods for bypassing protection, and response stages.
- Threat presentations - diagrams can demonstrate the consequences of attacks or weak points in the infrastructure.
- Document processes - diagrams help record the logic of task execution or the collection of data from various sources.
- Popular diagramming tools include:
- Microsoft Visio - a powerful tool for creating infrastructure, processes, and logical chains.
- draw.io (diagrams.net) - a free web tool for creating diagrams and diagrams.
- Figma is a convenient tool for creating interactive diagrams and mockups.

## Practice
A research analyst uses diagramming skills to:
- Illustrate attack methods - visualize attack chains, such as MITRE ATT&CK or the sequential steps of attackers.
- Explain compromise scenarios - diagrams can show how an attacker bypassed defenses or escalated privileges.
- Document data collection processes - diagrams make it easier to visualize complex workflows.
- Create diagrams for reports and presentations - visualize key data to make conclusions more compelling and compelling.

## Connection with other knowledge
Skills in creating diagrams are closely related to:
- Presentation of results - diagrams help to structure conclusions and make presentations more informative.
- Threat Intelligence - diagrams are often used to illustrate the relationships between attack groups, their techniques, and their goals.
- Incident Analysis - visualization of chains of events helps to describe the course of an attack and identify its weak links.
- Working with Red and Blue Teams - diagrams are used to document the results of attacks or proposed protective measures.
- Process automation - diagrams can be used to describe the logic of task automation.

## How to improve
- Learn key tools: Master the capabilities of Visio, draw.io, or Figma to create different types of diagrams.
- Practice visualizing real-world cases: Try to display complex attacks, incident scenarios, or security schemes in a visual format.
- Practice diagrams with different levels of detail: Be able to create both high-level concepts and detailed diagrams with an accurate description of technical details.
- Develop the skill of structuring data: Practice dividing diagrams into logical blocks with clear headings and explanations.
- Use color accents: Use visual markers to highlight key elements or threats in diagrams.
- Develop the skill of minimalism: Avoid overloading diagrams with unnecessary elements - each detail should be valuable.
- Maintain a uniform design style: Develop your own approach to creating diagrams taking into account readability, clear logic, and visual appeal.
