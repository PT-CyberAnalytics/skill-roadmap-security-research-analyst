# Adaptive and structured thinking
## Description
This skill combines two key abilities: cognitive flexibility — the ability to easily switch between a deeply technical and a more humanistic approach — and structured thinking — the ability to build a logical, transparent research scheme. It is important for a research analyst to simultaneously understand the intricacies of technical artifacts (logs, attacks, vulnerabilities) and clearly present the results to a business audience, the media, or non-technical specialists.

## Practice
- Alternating styles: take the same topic (e.g., a phishing method or a report structure) and describe it twice: first “for an engineer” with technical details, then “for a manager” in terms of risks and consequences.
- Mind mapping: build a research map at the initial stage to see all the branches (technical, organizational, business aspects) and their connections.
- Research management template: before starting work, draw up a short plan-structure (introduction → methodology → results → conclusions → recommendations) and check that each step logically follows from the previous one.
- Reframing: in practice, take the same problem and retell it in different contexts (technical, managerial, media) to train “switching” thinking.

## Connection with other knowledge
- Communication skills: adapting your speech and delivering the material are closely related to the ability to choose the right “level” of presentation.
- Presenting results and preparing articles: a clear research structure and the ability to switch between them help to create understandable slides and texts.
- OSINT and data collection: when analyzing disparate sources (tech docs, social media, news), you need flexibility to combine quantitative and qualitative data.
- Threat Intelligence: creating a profile of attackers or threats requires both technical details and an understanding of motivation, context, and goals.

## How to improve
- Reading in different genres: alternate between analyzing technical reports (CVE, MITRE) and popular articles (blogs, media) to learn to “switch” between styles.
- Mind mapping practice: regularly draw idea maps for new topics to practice coherence and identify all branches of analysis.
- Anticipatory planning: before starting research, spend 10 minutes drawing up a clear skeleton plan; then check your work for compliance with this plan.
- Reflection techniques: after completing the research, analyze where the structure “sagged” or the transitions were unclear, and make improvements next time.
- Interdisciplinary tasks: participate in projects that require a combination of technical analysis and “soft” research (surveys, interviews, media analysis).
- Critical thinking courses: they will help you build the logic of argumentation and recognize inflexible patterns in your thinking.
- Retrospective with colleagues: Periodically discuss the structure of your research papers with technical and non-technical experts to get feedback and develop flexibility in delivery.
