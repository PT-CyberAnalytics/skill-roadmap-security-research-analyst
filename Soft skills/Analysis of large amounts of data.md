# Analysis of large amounts of data

## Description
Large data analysis is an important skill for an analyst who works with large amounts of data. The ability to effectively analyze such data allows one to effectively prepare large-scale studies and draw correct conclusions. This skill also includes the ability to organize data, structure it, and visualize the results for presentation in research materials.

## Practice
In their daily work, an analyst may encounter huge amounts of data coming from different sources. Firstly, it is important to study different data sources. Secondly, to learn how to effectively process and filter this data. It is important for an analyst to highlight the most important things and make informed conclusions. Studying the subject area, reviewing a large number of cases, diving "into the breadth" are important components in the tasks of an analyst.

## Connection with other knowledge
The ability to process and analyze large amounts of information is closely related to the use of tools, where analysts often build summary tables and graphs to present results. This skill is also important when communicating thoughts to different audiences. Top management prefers a short summary, which can hide hundreds of pages of descriptions. The ability to briefly and clearly present all the key results is an important trait of an analyst.
