# Visualization skills

## Description
Visualization skills enable you to present complex ideas, data, and research findings in a clear and understandable manner. Effective visualization helps to convey information to different levels of expertise, engage the observation process, and provide a deeper understanding of key aspects of the research. Well-designed graphs, charts, diagrams, and infographics make the analyst's work more persuasive, valuable, and understandable to all stakeholders.

## Practice
The analyst applies visualization skills to:
- Create graphs and charts that clearly show trends, correlations, and key insights from large volumes of data.
- Build diagrams and infographics that make it easier to understand complex processes, such as cyber-attacks, or information structures.
- Communicate research findings in presentations, meetings, or analytical reports.
- Visually explain threat scenarios or recommendations to technical and management professionals.
- Adapt the visual style depending on the audience, whether executives, technical professionals, or customers.

## Connection with other knowledge
Visualization skills are related to:
- Data analysis: Data processed in Excel, Python or SQL can be transformed into visual graphs or charts.
- Text editors and presentations: Visualizations are used in reports and presentations to improve the perception of information.
- Diagramming tools: Visio, draw.io or Figma help to visualize processes and structures.
- Communication skills: The ability to explain visualized data increases its impact and helps to achieve a common understanding among project participants.
