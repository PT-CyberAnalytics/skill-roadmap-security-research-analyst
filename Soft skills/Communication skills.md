# Communication skills

## Description
This section is dedicated to developing effective communication skills that help research analysts interact with teammates, technical specialists, and external partners. A research analyst must be able to clearly present their findings and justify hypotheses to both specialists with deep technical knowledge and representatives of business or the media.
As research analysts often interact with technical experts, including:
- Red Team — specialists in penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.
- Blue Team — specialists in infrastructure protection and incident response.
- Information security developers (ISD) — engineers who create solutions for monitoring, filtering traffic, access control, and data protection.
- System and network administrators — specialists responsible for the operation and support of the infrastructure.

An important skill of a research analyst is the ability to adapt the communication style to the audience:
- When communicating with technical experts - correctly operate with terms, attack methods and protective measures.
- When communicating with businesses - formulate conclusions with an emphasis on business risks and consequences.
- When interacting with the media - convey complex technical aspects in an accessible form.

## Practice
The research analyst applies communication skills to:
- Interact with the Red Team — correctly describe attack techniques, methods of bypassing security solutions and ways of exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Interact with the Blue Team — form recommendations for monitoring, identifying threats and responding to incidents.
- Work with ISS developers — provide feedback on possible shortcomings of solutions, including a description of attack techniques.
- Participate in incident analysis — joint threat analysis with technical specialists to identify the root causes of attacks.
- Prepare recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities — taking into account the specifics of the infrastructure and operational realities.
- Prepare materials for the media — adapt complex technical topics for a wide audience.
- Business correspondence with partners and clients — competent presentation of conclusions and proposals.

## Connection with other knowledge
Communication skills are closely related to:
- Threat Intelligence — the analyst must be able to correctly convey information about identified threats to Red and Blue Team specialists.
- Presentation of results — it is important to be able to present information in a structured and clear manner at conferences, meetings or in the media.
- Analysis of incidents — correct communication helps to promptly share the results of the analysis with response teams.
- Working with technical documentation — the analyst must clearly describe the findings and recommendations so that specialists can correctly interpret and implement them.

## How to improve
- Practice communicating with technical experts: Participate in joint discussions with the Red and Blue Teams to develop the skill of arguing your conclusions.
- Develop the skill of adapting your speech to the audience: Be able to flexibly switch from complex technical terminology to simple and accessible explanations for non-technical specialists.
- Learn the techniques of constructive criticism: When communicating with ISS developers, it is important to correctly point out errors or shortcomings in solutions without causing conflicts.
- Practice the skill of holding meetings and briefings: Learn to quickly and accurately explain your conclusions in team meetings or threat analysis sessions.
- Work on confidence in communication: Regular practice in meetings, team meetings, and discussions will help increase confidence in presenting your ideas.
- Develop the skill of argumentation: The ability to support your conclusions with facts and evidence will increase your authority among technical specialists.
- Participate in trainings on effective communication: Courses on negotiation techniques, dialogue management or conflict management will help improve communication skills.
- Learn teamwork techniques: Understanding the principles of effective teamwork will allow you to build productive interactions with the Red and Blue Teams.
- Regularly conduct public speaking and presentation training to confidently present audit results and reports to customers and top management.
- Participate in soft skills and communication training to improve your skills in interacting with different levels of specialists and establish effective communication in the team.
- Practice meeting with different groups of specialists to improve your ability to coordinate and collaborate with technical and non-technical teams.
